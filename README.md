Adventures in computer science  

Conventions:

- Doxygen comments where supported
- K&R style formatting 
- All lowercase filenames
- Use .hpp instead of .h for C++ headers
- Include guards for a file named filename.hpp look like:  
    `#ifdef FILENAME_HPP` 
    -before the underscore is the uppercase filename stripped of any special symbols 
    -after the underscore is the uppercase extension
- Keep solutions to one self-contained file, if possible.
- Try to keep to 80 character lines. 
- Use `#include <file.h>` over `#include "file.h"` in accordance with JSF AV Rule 33
